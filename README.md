Running the app

Preferably, first create a virtualenv and activate it, perhaps with the following command:

virtualenv -p python3 venv


Next, run

pip install -r requirements.txt

to get the dependencies.

Next, import the database from console

from app import db

Finally run the app with
python app.py

Navigate to the posted URL in your terminal to be greeted with Postman, where you can test out the API.
